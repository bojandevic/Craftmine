# Craftmine

This is a simple Minecraft clone made in Unity 3D using generic cube objects. Terrain is generated in chunks of 33x33 blocks using Perlin noise. Only chunks that are close to the player are being rendered. 
This is not the efficient or complete way of making this it is ment to be a exercise.
